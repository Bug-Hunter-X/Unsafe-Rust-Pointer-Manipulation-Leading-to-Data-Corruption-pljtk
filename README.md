This repository showcases a common error in unsafe Rust: directly manipulating memory via raw pointers. The `bug.rs` file contains code that demonstrates this error, while `bugSolution.rs` provides a safer alternative using Rust's built-in vector methods.  This example highlights the importance of understanding memory management in unsafe Rust and utilizing safer alternatives whenever possible to prevent data corruption and undefined behavior.
